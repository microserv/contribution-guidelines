## <a name="commit-messages"></a> How to write commit messages
Will be added whenever I get the time.

## <a name="rules"></a> Coding rules
Will be added whenever we have decided on some general rules and style guides.

## Licenses
We'll need to figure this one out. [MIT](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) should work for most of our code, but we'll have to be careful when including third party libraries.
